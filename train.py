# train.py

# This script should handle the preprocessing steps in a reproducible manner,
# train the model, and save the trained model to disk.
# Use functions or a pipeline to encapsulate preprocessing steps,
# ensuring they are applied consistently during training and prediction.
# This script will likely use sklearn's Pipeline or ColumnTransformer
# to streamline preprocessing and model training.


# Import necessary libraries
