# Immo Charlie Phase 03: Price Predictor

[![forthebadge made-with-python](https://ForTheBadge.com/images/badges/made-with-python.svg)](https://www.python.org/)

## 📖 Description

This Price Predictor is built to predict residential property prices.

It takes a dataset of properties and their features as input, runs it through an ML pipeline, and outputs its predictions.

Current project stage: training and evaluating various ML models. Will update soon to leave only the best performing model and clean the repo, before moving on to the 4th and last phase of the project.

## Status:

- the saved_models folder with the pickle files is not pushed to this repo yet from local machine (need to handle large file uploads to git)
- the MODELCARD is work-in-progress
- predict.py is work-in-progress


## 🛠️ Features

- **Multiple Model Training**: Supports training with various machine learning algorithms including Linear Regression, CatBoost, XGBoost, Random Forest, and more, allowing for easy experimentation and model comparison.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes a comprehensive data preprocessing pipeline (`preprocessing/data_preprocessor.py`) that cleans, imputes, and encodes the dataset, preparing it for training and prediction.
- **Predictions on New Data**: Utilizes a separate `predict.py` script to load trained models and make predictions on new datasets, making the project ready for real-world application.
- **Modular Design**: The project is structured for clarity, separating data, models, training, and prediction scripts for easy navigation and development.

### 🚀 Upcoming Features

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Implementation of a systematic approach to fine-tune the hyperparameters of various models to improve performance.
- **Automated New Data Validation & Preprocessing**: Introducing automated checks to validate new datasets against the model's expected input schema.
- **API Deployment**: Creating a RESTful API for the model, allowing for easy integration into web services and applications for real-time predictions. (this will be stage 4 out of a total of 4 for this project)
- **...**


## 👩‍💻 Usage

To use this project for training a model or making predictions, follow these steps:

### Training a Model

1. Place your training dataset in the `data/` directory.
2. Choose the model training script from the `models/` directory (e.g., `train_linear_regression.py`).
3. Run the script to train the model. This will also save the trained model in the `saved_models/` directory.

Example:

```

python3 models/train_xgboost (# note: do not include .py when running)

```


### Making Predictions

1. Ensure you have a trained model saved in the `saved_models/` directory.
2. Place the new dataset for prediction in the `data/` directory.
3. Update the `predict.py` script with the correct paths for the model and the new dataset.
4. Run `predict.py` to preprocess the new dataset and make predictions. This will print predictions to the console or save to a file (--_to be updated once I finalise writing predict.py_--))


```

python3 predict.py

```


## 📂 Project background & timeline

This is the third phase of a four-phase project to create a complete ML pipeline for predicting residential property prices. This project phase took one week to complete in March 2024.

The project was completed as part of my 7-month AI training bootcamp at BeCode in Ghent, Belgium.


## ⚠️ Warning

All my code is currently *heavily*:

- docstringed
- commented

.. and sometimes typed.

This is to help me learn and for my feedback sessions with our coach.
