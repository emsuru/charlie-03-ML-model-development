## 📂 Project background

This project is phase 3 out of a 4-phase ML project I did as part of my [AI Bootcamp training by BeCode](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-data-science-course-complete-data-science-bootcamp/).


## ⚠️ Warning

All my code is currently *heavily*:

- docstringed
- commented

.. and sometimes typed.

This is to help me learn and for my feedback sessions with our coach.
